Day12-WorkingWithYoeman
=======================

First attempt working with Yoeman / Making 15 samples of JQuery

This assignment was to create a site using 15 examples of JQuery.  This was a great assignment as I learned all about the following JQuery methods:

.click<BR>
.after<BR>
.before<BR>
.animate<BR>
.empty<BR>
.not<BR>
.show<BR>
.delay<BR>
.remove<BR>
.prepend<BR>
.children<BR>
.css<BR>
.parent<BR>
.prev<BR>

This was also a great learning experience as I got to use Yoeman and webapp to build and develop the page.

Below is a link to the live page:<BR>
